This project is to scrap an article from a website "https://www.python.org/" and find word frequency of every word from data that we scrap.

Worke done on Project:

First I loaded ralated libraries mentioned above to work on website "https://www.python.org/" to scrap data.

Then write program to scrap data in multiple ways.

Then write a program to save data in text file in same folder.

Finally I wrote program to count word frequency of all the words available in text file scraped and saved.

Latest_articles.txt is the data that saved in text file by program (Scraping and save file in text by own.py).

New_articles_new_way.txt is the data saved in text file by program (Another way of scraping.py).

(Scraping by mam.py) file is written to scrap Upcoming events from the website "https://www.python.org/"

(Word frequency by own.py) and (Word frequency by mam.py), both program are written to find word frequency in saved text file. 

A PPT(Web scraping and count frequency of words) is also attached showing the details related to the project.
